# Spring Boot DevTools (if used)
# If you use spring-boot-devtools, it might create files that you don't want to commit.
# For example, if you use live reload features, it might create temporary files.
# Add specific patterns here if needed based on your devtools usage.

# Application specific - if you have local configuration files not meant for the repo
# For example:
# application-local.properties
# application-dev.yml

# Operating System files
.DS_Store # macOS
Thumbs.db # Windows
ehthumbs.db # Windows
Desktop.ini # Windows
$RECYCLE.BIN/ # Windows Recycle Bin

# Secrets and sensitive information - ALWAYS keep these out of your repository
# Consider using environment variables or a secrets management tool
# For example:
# .env
# secrets.yml
# *.pem
# *.key

# Specific to certain libraries or tools you might add
# For example, if using H2 database in file mode for local dev:
# *.mv.db
# *.trace.db
